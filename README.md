**[A description of what has been implemented]** </br>
The Great Joffrey Hosencratz wants to keep track of all the known squirrels and plans to start with Central Park.
Upon his request, I built an application that can import the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data and allow his team to add, update, and view squirrel data. 

##Squarrel: The site directory like mysite.
##Tracking: The app directory. This has models.py, views.py, and others as well.

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/) |

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an end-to-end open source platform
for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of
[tools](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/tools),
[libraries](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/libraries-extensions), and
[community](https://www.tensorflow.org/community) resources that lets
researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and
deploy ML-powered applications.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the
Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization to
conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research. The system is
general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well.

TensorFlow provides stable [Python](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python)
and [C++](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc) APIs, as well as
non-guaranteed backward compatible API for
[other languages](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs).

## Install

See the [TensorFlow install guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) for the
[pip package](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip), to
[enable GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu), use a
[Docker container](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker), and
[build from source](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source).
