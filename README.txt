[A description of what has been implemented]
The Great Joffrey Hosencratz wants to keep track of all the known squirrels and plans to start with Central Park.
Upon his request, I built an application that can import the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data and allow his team to add, update, and view squirrel data. 

Squarrel: The site directory like mysite.
Tracking: The app directory. This has models.py, views.py, and others as well.
